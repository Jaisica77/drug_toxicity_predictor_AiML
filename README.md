# 🧪 Drug Toxicity Predictor (AiML)

A machine learning–based system to **predict drug toxicity** using molecular descriptors and RDKit features.  
This tool helps evaluate potential toxicity *before market release*; if predicted toxicity score is above threshold (e.g., 50%), the drug candidate is flagged as non-viable.

This project uses AI/ML techniques to analyze chemical properties and predict safety profiles of drug candidates *in silico* — reducing reliance on costly and time-consuming lab tests.

## 🚀 Overview

In modern drug discovery, early toxicity screening is critical for safety and cost efficiency. Computational toxicology uses molecular structure data and machine learning to estimate potential safety risks. These models typically work by generating molecular descriptors (physicochemical, topological, structural) and training classifiers to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic compounds. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This repository implements a proof-of-concept using RDKit descriptors combined with machine learning to predict toxicity outcomes for given drug candidates.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of **chemical compounds represented using SMILES notation**, along with corresponding **toxicity labels or scores**.  
It is derived from **publicly available toxicology datasets commonly used in computational drug discovery**, such as **Tox21**, and is suitable for **machine learning–based toxicity prediction**.

Each compound is processed using **RDKit** to compute molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties, which serve as input features for the AI/ML models used in this project.

### 🔬 Feature Generation (Using RDKit)

The following molecular descriptors are generated for each compound:

- Molecular Weight  
- LogP (octanol–water partition coefficient)  
- Number of Hydrogen Bond Donors  
- Number of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors  
- Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)  
- Number of Rotatable Bonds  
- Additional structural and physicochemical descriptors  

These features capture the **chemical and structural characteristics** of drug candidates and are widely used in **QSAR and toxicity modeling**.

### 🧪 Target Variable (Toxicity Classification)

- **Toxicity Score / Label**
  - Drug candidates with a predicted toxicity score **≥ 50%** are classified as **potentially toxic** and are **not recommended for market release**.
  - Candidates below this threshold are considered **relatively safer** for further evaluation and downstream testing.

This threshold-based decision rule supports **early-stage screening** and helps reduce risks associated with late-stage drug failure.
